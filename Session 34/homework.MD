## PROBLEM -1: PREVIEW IN MARKDOWN!!

## PROBLEM 0: HISTOGRAM

This problem is similar to the last two problems where I will provide you with an end product and some starting materials. In this exercise you will create a historgram of pixel intensities. You will find the [geom_histogram](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html) function particularly necessary. Make sure you specify the number of bins = 256.

Create a small and large plot in the output directory. I modelled the much easier medium file. You may find a call to melt helpful.... >:)



## PROBLEM 1: VECTORIZATION OF FLOYD-STEINBERG

Please think about how we can create a vectorized implementation (if at all!) of Floyd-Steinberg.
