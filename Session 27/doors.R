# there are 100 doors and they are all set to the same state
# you visit every door and change its state
# you repeat this process but every time you do so
# the doors you visit changes according to how many times you've already visited the doors
# the first time you visit every door: 1, 2, 3, 4 ...
# the second time you visit the even doors: 2, 4, 6, 8...
# the third time you visit doors 3, 6, 9...
# and so on
# Do this 100 times
