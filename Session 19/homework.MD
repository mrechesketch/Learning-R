1. This weeks homework focuses on environments. Read over the envirohash.R file. A Set_ class is defined that is a convenient refClass wrapper for some *simple* environment operations. There are many functions we haven't used heavily (or at all) like assign, get, remove and ls. Pay close attention to the following:
    i. The tryCatch() in the $has method 
    ii. the ... in the Set(...) constructor
2. Read over the example uses of the Set_ class and notice the flexibility of the constructor with arguments of variable size
3. Complete %sub%, %super%, %I% and %E% functions
4. Create a new function that uses $delete and write the appropriate tests
