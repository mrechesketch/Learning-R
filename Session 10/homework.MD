ok so I made some big changes to our BST.. mostly because the insertAtNode approach was not going to work
i made a add function that is a memebr of node instead. your homework has a couple parts:

1. write tests for size and height -- i think height should work but please check it. we will be plotting it! 
2. I wrote a treeNode constructor test but it's not passing. figure that out please 
3. the add function doesn't currently handle size at all. fix it. (you should notice this when the the awesome size tests you write don't pass)
4. (EXTRA CREDIT) the deleteNode approach isn't going to work either. fill in the delete member method of node so that it does. (difficult)
5. check out the add function of purchase list in Anomaly detection and be able to explain it!!
