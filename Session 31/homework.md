## HOMEWORK

1. Please read [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Performance.html) which compares performance of ref classes, r6 and environments

2. Create a calculate function which takes in a person and returns their running percentile donation . Refer to the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) on what answer you should be getting. I already did the easy part of calculating the ceiling of perc * number. I created a person list for you to test with. Our updatePerson function is fucked up right now :(. We can trouble shoot it tomorrow or I'll fix it before we meet. Feel free to look at it and play around with it yourself. **update 02/21 12:30** I fixed our updatePerson method so now it inserts items in the correct order. Our approach was a bit flawed, we can talk about it tonight.
