1. (*Session 19/EnviroMap*) Write the LetterBag function and at least two tests for it. The function's body should be quite short. 
2. (*Session 19/EnviroMap*) Write the %subset% function. This function will be a bit tricker but the tests are provided. 
3. We're going to make our scrabbler thingy. Conceptualize how this "thingy" will operate in design.MD. Design the process of deciding what words can be made up from a vector of letters. In addition to writing down any thoughts of pseudo-code you might have please answer these questions:
    i. What are the pros & cons of using a closure vs a reference class? 
    ii. When we load the dictionary, how will we associate a word with its conjugate LetterBag?
    iii. Write some pseudo-code for loading a dictionary line by line (peek at the printLines_2 function of *Session 10/jsonToPurchases*)
4. Move that big ass file you got from work into Session 21 as a csv and make ONE plot of anything. Doesn't not have to be complicated. Do this in workFile.R. (see *Session 16/energy* for if you need some inspiration on opening as csv into a dataframe)
