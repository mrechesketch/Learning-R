This weeks homework has 1 reading and working on some short exercises on string manipulation

1. Read on spokes and we're going to figure out how to make our tree look awesome: http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_spoke.html. Warning, working in r-theta can be difficult when you're used to living in an x-y world.

2. Complete functions in dateStrings.R. These exercises are going to turn date strings like "2017-09-29 18:46:40" into month strings like "Septmeber" so we can make those pretty bar-color plots. REMEBER TO ACTUALY TEST THE FUNCTIONS OUT IN THE INTERPRETTER!!!!! (if you need help changing directories and shit just text me)
