1. Look in PointGroup.R at exercise 1. The warnings we were recieving were the result of the file being opened and never closed. We were using on.exit(close(con)) to close the connection however for some reason this didn't work. You can manually close the con yourself with close(con) after you are done using the file. I might suggest getting in the habit of closing the file yourself instead of delegating that task to R because clearly the automatic way is not as easy to use as we thought.
2. Look in exercise 2 at the PointGroup function. Pay attention to line where the data frame is created with read.csv( filePath, row.names = 1 ). The row.names = 1 prevents the extra 1, 2, 3 ... from getting inserted automatically as the first column of our data frame.
3. Complete exercise 3: coef, order and orderFromName
4. Complete exercise 4: the reduction of a reducible representation. I will be very impressed if you complete this as it this is a high level chemistry concept and you have little chemistry background. Try to focus on the reduction formula and how that relates to vectorization. The actual computational part will be a breeze.
